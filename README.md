### The Clone of Google' Official Website

Made the clone of Google's official website. You can search from it and it shows the google results. No ads though lol. Do keep in mind that it is not responsive cuz I will be departing from my home from 17 hours from now (as the time I am writing this) to my military college where i will stay for like 4 years. So I have no time to do anything else. Maybe I will update it later when i finally get back home but I am sorry I dont have any more time.

Used React, Tailwind, CSS, Typescript and Yarn in this project
I didnt use the Google's official Search API cuz Im broke and have no money
Instead i used a API from Rapid Api which is unlimited searches for free (I know its dumb but whatever)

Time took for this project: 4 - 5 hours

### Also do note that all of this is my code, I didnt copy it from any other sources. Feel free to copy my project
